# 🍕 Pizza Slice Folders Club 🍕

Welcome to **Pizza Slice Folders Club** — the (un)official coalition of people who know there’s only *one* way to eat pizza: folded. For those who believe that a pizza slice deserves to be held in half, like a sacred text, while everything else in life falls apart around us. 

## Who We Are
We’re an elite crew of open-source devs by day and edgy pizza devotees by night. Founders of this Club are two code-tweaking, grunge-loving web developers who decided the world needed a little more respect for the fine art of the fold. And we’re building this entire brand from scratch on GitHub, because what better place for a revolution?

We’re not here to convince you why folded is better. If you don’t get it, you probably think pineapple belongs on pizza, and honestly, that’s between you and your tastebuds. 🍍 But if you’re down to spread the *fold gospel* — through t-shirts, hoodies, and some spicy sticker designs — then you’re one of us.

## Why GitHub?
Some say pizza is best made by hand, with love, in a wood-fired oven. We say it’s best made open source and version controlled. Because true pizza love doesn’t gatekeep. Our brand’s whole journey, from napkin sketches to (inevitably sarcastic) customer feedback, is documented right here. That way, anyone else with an unhealthy obsession with pizza can watch us make mistakes, fork them, or roast us on PRs.

## Club Rules
1. **Fold Your Pizza**: Respect the craft.
2. **Respect the Grunge**: No "fun fonts" here, please.
3. **Stay Sarcastic**: We’re in this for the laughs. Leave your earnestness at the door.
4. **Love Pizza. But Mostly the Fold**: If your dream pizza is a crisp slice folded just right, we’re gonna get along just fine.

## Contributing
You got ideas? Weird, that’s cool. Fork the repo, submit a PR, or just leave your sarcastic comments in the Issues section.
